## üêõ Bug Fix: React Closure Issue in Adaptive Chart

### Problem
The adaptive timeframe switching feature was failing after the first transition due to a React closure bug. The `setInterval` callback was capturing the initial state value and never seeing updates.

### Root Cause
- `setInterval` in `useEffect` with empty dependency array creates a closure
- The interval callback always saw `currentTimeframe` as its initial value
- Even after state updates, the interval logic used stale data

### Solution
Implemented `useRef` to mirror the state value:
- `currentTimeframeRef` maintains the current timeframe value
- All interval logic now uses `currentTimeframeRef.current`
- Both state and ref are updated together to keep them in sync

### Changes Made
1. Added `currentTimeframeRef` to track current timeframe in real-time
2. Updated all interval logic to use the ref instead of state
3. Modified `switchTimeframe` to pass `previousTimeframe` for correct bar spacing calculations
4. Fixed comparison logic in `loadDataAndMaintainView`

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Zoom in from 1h ‚Üí switches to 15m
- ‚úÖ Zoom out from 15m ‚Üí switches back to 1h  
- ‚úÖ Multiple zoom transitions work correctly
- ‚úÖ Manual timeframe selection still works

### Lessons Learned
This is a common React pattern that developers should watch for:
- Any callback in `useEffect` with `[]` dependencies will capture initial state
- Use `useRef` for values that need to be accessed in long-lived callbacks
- This applies to: intervals, timers, event listeners, WebSocket handlers
